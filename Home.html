				<h3>Introduction <img src="Imagini/ArrUp.png" alt="ArrUp" class="sageata"></h3>
				<div class="continut">
					<p>Colombia is a country located mostly in South America, with territories in Central America. 
					It is one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse countries in the world giving rise to a rich cultural heritage. 
					This has also been influenced by Colombia's varied geography, which also encompasses the Amazon rainforest, Los Llanos (the Plains), the Andes
					mountain range and coastlines to both the Carribean Sea and Pacific Ocean.</p>
					<p>Despite having a recent history dominated by corruption, guerrillas and drug lords, Colombia has taken the road of peace and stability,
					with its past being left behind to make room for prosperity.</p>

				<h3>History <img src="Imagini/ArrUp.png" alt="ArrUp" class="sageata"></h3>
				<div class="continut">
					<article>
						<h4>Pre-Columbian era <img src="Imagini/ArrUp.png" alt="ArrUp" class="sageata"></h4>
						<div class="continut">
							<p>The territory that is now Colombia has been inhabited by humans starting as far back as 10,500 BCE. Before Christofer Columbus' arrival,
							groups of Amerindians including the Muisca, Quimbaya, Tairona and Caribs developed their own political system. The Incas expanded their empire
							on the southwest part of the country.</p>

						<h4>Spanish rule <img src="Imagini/ArrUp.png" alt="ArrUp" class="sageata"></h4>
						<div class="continut">
							<p>Alonso de Ojeda, who had sailed with Christofer Columbus, was the first to discover the mainland in 1499, when he reached the Guajira Peninsula.
							In 1510, Santa María la Antigua del Darién, the first stable settlement on the continent, was founded by Vasco Núñez de Balboa. The newly discovered
							land was christened the "New Kingdom of Granada", and its provisionary capital would be founded in august 1538, near the Muisca kingdom of Bacatá.
							Originally named Santa Fe, it would later be renamed to Santa Fe de Bogotá and then Bogotá.</p>
							<p>In 1542, the region would become part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, with the capital at Lima, but in 1717, the Viceroyalty of New Granada
							would be created, temporarily removed, and then recreated in 1739.</p>
							<p>Following the Spanish conquest, the indigenous people were experiencing a decline in population caused by the conquest itself, but also
							because of the diseases introduced by the Europeans, such as smallpox. Repopulation was achieved by allowing Spanish farmers to settle along with
							their families. In the 16th century, African slaves would be brought to work on the plantations or in the mines. Amerindian people could not
							be enslaved because they were legal subjects of the Spanish Crown.</p>

						<h4>Independence and aftermath <img src="Imagini/ArrUp.png" alt="ArrUp" class="sageata"></h4>
						<div class="continut">
							<p>Since the beginning of the periods of conquest and colonization, there were several rebel movements against Spanish rule,
							but most were either crushed or remained too weak to change the overall situation.
							The last one that sought outright independence from Spain sprang up around 1810, following the independence of St. Domingue (present-day Haiti)
							in 1804, which provided some support to the eventual leaders of this rebellion: Simón Bolívar and Francisco de Paula Santander.</p>
							<p>Independence fighting started across the country following the flower vase incident in Bogotá, after a Spanish merchant called Llorente refused to
							lend a vase to a group of criollos (Spanish people born in South America) who wanted to honour another criollo. This has angered the populace,
							who attacked Llorente, and caused the rebellion against Spanish rule. Following, several other cities declared independence and initially defeated
							the Spanish, but the differences in how they wanted to governate caused a civil war, which ended in Spanish reconquest.</p>
							<p>Simón Bolívar and Francisco de Paula Santander eventually liberated the colonies from the Spanish Crown, with independence proclaimed in 1819.
							Bolivar became the first President of Gran Colombia (which was the union of present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador), and Francisco
							Vice President. The union was unstable, though, and Gran Colombia collapsed in 1830, resulting in the emergence of New Granada, Ecuador and
							Venezuela.</p>
							<p>Following these events was a period of strife and internal division. The country eventually became known as the Republic of Colombia in 1886.
							In 1903, with influence from the United States, the Department of Panama declared independece from Colombia. During the 20th century, the situation
							wasn't any better, as the country had went through civil war and a coup d'état, and saw the formation of several guerrilla groups such as the FARC, 
							ELN, EPL and many others.</p>
							<p>In recent years though, the country started to recover. Most of the guerrilla groups had ceased to exist and negotiations had been started with
							the others. The country is no longer as dangerous as it used to be, and has also won a seat on the Security Council of the UN.</p>

				<h3>Geography <img src="Imagini/ArrUp.png" alt="ArrUp" class="sageata"></h3>
				<div class="continut">
					<p>The geography of Colombia is characterized by its six main natural regions that present their own unique characteristics:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The Andes mountain range region shared with Ecuador and Venezuela;</li> 
						<li>The Pacific coastal region shared with Panama and Ecuador;</li>
						<li>The Caribbean coastal region shared with Venezuela and Panama;</li>
						<li>The Llanos (plains) shared with Venezuela;</li>
						<li>The Amazon Rainforest region shared with Venezuela, Brazil, Peru and Ecuador;</li>
						<li>The insular area, comprising islands in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Despite its size, most of the population resides in the mountainous western region, as well as the northern coastal area. Many Colombians live in
					or around Bogotá, while the southern and eastern portions of the country are mostly sparsely populated tropical rainforest and inland plains containing
					livestock farms, oil and gas production facilities, small farming communities and indigenous tribes.</p>
					<p>The diverse relief and location on the globe made Colombia one of the 17 megadiverse countries. The difference in elevation also brings many climate
					differences among regions, ranging from snow capped mountains to tropical rainforests and hot deserts.</p>

							<p>In terms of culture, many aspects of it can be traced back to the early culture of Spain of the 16th century, and also of the native population
							which has been assimilated over time. The Spanish had brought with them Catholicism, Africans, 
							the feudal encomienda system, and a caste system that favored European-born whites.</p>
